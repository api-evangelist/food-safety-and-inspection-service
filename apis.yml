  The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is a branch of the United States
  Department of Agriculture (USDA) responsible for ensuring the safety of the
  nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS inspectors
  work tirelessly to enforce strict regulations and guidelines that govern the
  processing and distribution of these products, conducting routine inspections
  of facilities to ensure they meet sanitation and food safety standards.
  Additionally, FSIS is responsible for investigating reports of foodborne
  illnesses and outbreaks, taking swift action to prevent further contamination
  and protect public health. Overall, the primary mission of FSIS is to
  safeguard the food supply and prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses
  through thorough inspection and regulation.
